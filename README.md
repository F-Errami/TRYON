# TRYON

The project named Tryon is an innovative mobile application enabling the reconstruction of objects from multiple images. Initially focused on clothing reconstruction, this application aims to create a virtual dressing room offering an immersive experience. Its fundamental concept lies in the ability to reconstruct clothing items through a series of images, thus providing users with the opportunity to virtually explore different outfits. Tryon aspires to revolutionize the way consumers interact with clothing by providing a platform where they can visualize and try on clothes without the need to physically wear them.
